# Assignment 4: Decision Making
### Answer
###### To decide if the team deserves a bonus, I have analyzed the average error queries obtained from total queries over a period of 7 weeks.
###### In order to have regular & clean results I have used the weeks between August 6 & September 23, setting aside first days of August and final days of September wich have some irregularities (doesn't have the total of queries counted during the day). These isolated days have been equally analyzed under the same criteria and have been used as a reference for the final decision.

##### Results Table
####
| Weeks        | Averages Errors Queries from Total Queries          | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Week 1 (6 to 12)      | 1,54 % |
| Week 2 (6 to 12)      | 3,73 %      |  
| Week 3 (6 to 12) | 0,99 %      |   
| Week 4 (6 to 12) | 1,41 %| 
| Week 5 (6 to 12) | 1,24 %      | 
| Week 6 (6 to 12) | 0,72 %      | 
| Week 6 (7 to 12) | 0,96 %     | 

##### Final Decision

###### The results shows an increase in the 'errors queries' between first days of August (starting at 1,18%), and second week (the peak at 3,73%). Since then, the percentage decrease considerably until set the average arround a 1% (even ending September at 0,71%).

###### Considering this decrease of the percentage and the stability in a low average for 'Error Queries' during last 4 weeks (+ final days of Septembers), I think the team deserves the bonus.
